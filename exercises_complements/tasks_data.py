We must have that $ V_{in} = V_{out} $.

Water input volume over 1 day is $ V_{in} = P \times A \times t $ where:
- $ P $ is the precipitation recharge rate in km/day, $ P = 1 \text{mm/day} = 1 \times 10^{-6} \text{km/day} $
- $ A $ is the area of the catchment in $\text{km}^2$
- $ t $ is 1 day

Water output volume over 1 day is $ V_{out} = Q \times t $ where:
- $ Q $ is the flow rate in $\text{km}^3$/day, $ Q = 20 \text{L}/\text{s} = 1728 \text{m}^3/\text{day} = 1728 \times 10^{-9} \text{km}^3/\text{day} $
- $ t $ is 1 day

So we have that $ P \times A \times t = Q \times t $

We can solve $ A = \frac{1728 \times 10^{-9}}{1 \times 10^{-6}} \simeq 1.7 \text{km}^2 $.

This is not far from the BAFU estimation of 1.58 kmÂ², as you can see on the following snapshot.

The volume of water $V_{out}$ going out from the aquifer in one residence time period $\tau$ is needed to estimate the volume of the aquifer itself $V_{aq}$. We also need to take into account the aquifer porosity. 

Overall we have that $V_{aq} = \frac{V_{out}}{\phi}$ where :
- $V_{out} = Q \times \tau = 1728 \text{m}^3/\text{day} \times 365 \text{ day} = 1728 \times 365 \text{m}^3 $
- ${\phi} = 0.2$

Finally, $V_{aq} = 1728 \times 365 \text{m}^3 / 0.2 = 3153600 \text{m}^3$

The thickness is : $M_{aq} = \frac{V_{aq}}{A}$. $A$ being known, we still need to compute the aquifer volume $V_{aq}$.

The volume of water $V_{out}$ going out from the aquifer in one residence time period $\tau$ is needed to estimate the volume of the aquifer itself $V_{aq}$. We also need to take into account the aquifer porosity. 

Overall we have that $V_{aq} = \frac{V_{out}}{\phi}$ where :
- $V_{out} = Q \times \tau = 1728 \text{m}^3/\text{day} \times 365 \text{ day} = 1728 \times 365 \text{m}^3 $
- ${\phi} = 0.2$

Finally, $V_{aq} = 1728 \times 365 \text{m}^3 / 0.2 = 3153600 \text{m}^3$

Back to the mean aquifer thickness : $M_{aq} = \frac{V_{aq}}{A} = \frac{3123600}{1.7} \frac{ \text{m}^3 }{\text{km}^2} = \frac{3123600}{1.7 \times 10^6}\text{m} \simeq 1.9 \text{m}$

"task01_4": r"""

The lower bound $A_{min}$ of the area is given by the lower bound of the precipitation recharge rate $P_{min}$ and the upper bound of the flow rate $Q_{max}$.

We have that $A_{min} = \frac{Q_{min}}{P_{max}}$.
- $P_{max} = 1.1 \text{mm/day} = 1.1 \times 10^{-6} \text{km/day}$
- $Q_{min} = 15 \text{L}/\text{s} = 1296 \text{m}^3/\text{day} = 1296 \times 10^{-9} \text{km}^3/\text{day}$
It results that $A_{min} = \frac{1296 \times 10^{-9}}{1.1 \times 10^{-6}} \simeq 1.2 \text{km}^2$.

You might want to have a look at the following interactive plot which shows all possible values of $A$ reachable given the uncertainety intervals for $P$ and $Q$.

According to Darcy 's law, we have that :

$q = KI = K \cdot \frac{\Delta h}{L} = 0.0005 \cdot \frac{0.4}{1} = 12.5 \cdot 10^{-4} \cdot\text{m}\text{s}^{-1} = 1.25 \cdot \text{mm}\text{s}^{-1}$.

The discharge is derived from the specific discharge, accounting for the soil column cross section area :

The mean velocity is derived from the specific discharge, accounting for the soil column effective porosity : 

$u = \frac{q}{\phi_e} = 
 \frac{1.25 \cdot 10^{-3}}{0.2} = 6.25 \cdot 10^{-3} \cdot\text{m}.\text{s}^{-1} = 6.25 \cdot \text{mm}.\text{s}^{-1}$.

$K$ can be derived from the slope of the linear fit ( Darcy's law : $q$ = $K \cdot I$).<br>From the graph, its value is $0.30$  $\text{mm}.\text{s}^{-1}$.<br> Be careful about the units : on the graph, $q$ is given in $\text{mm}.\text{s}^{-1}$.

The Darcy law is : $h(x) = -\frac{q}{K}(x - x_0) + h_0$ where:
- $q = 0.000003 \text{m}^2$ /s
- $K = 0.00005 \text{m/day}$
- $x_0 = 0 \text{m}$
- $h_0 = 50 \text{m}$
- $x = 200 \text{m}$

As a result, $h(200) = -\frac{0.000003}{0.00005}(200 - 0) + 50 = 38.0 \text{m}$

"task04_2": r"""

The solution is the same as for the previous question, but plugging $x$ = 400m instead.

As a result, $h(400) = -\frac{0.000003}{0.00005}(400 - 0) + 50 = 26.0 \text{m}$
