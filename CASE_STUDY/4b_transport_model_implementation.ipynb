    "## 1. Overview: Learning Path for Contaminant Transport Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to add contaminant transport processes to an existing groundwater flow model. We follow a systematic approach that builds confidence through verification before tackling complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 The Problem: Contaminant Plume Migration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** A point source releases contaminants into the Limmat Valley aquifer. We need to predict:\n",
    "- How far will the plume migrate?\n",
    "- What concentrations will reach downstream locations?\n",
    "- Can we trust our numerical model predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The Approach: Simple to Complex\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than immediately jumping to a complex 2.5D Limmat Valley model, we follow professional best practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Learn the Theory (Section 2)**\n",
    "- Understand transport processes (advection, dispersion, reactions)\n",
    "- Learn the governing equations with forcing terms\n",
    "- Understand how MT3D-USGS couples with MODFLOW\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Verify with Analytical Solution (Section 3)**\n",
    "- Implement the analytical solution for 1D pulse source transport problem\n",
    "- Understand what the \"correct\" answer should look like\n",
    "- Test the analytical solution with different parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Verify MT3D with 1D Test (Section 4)**\n",
    "- Create idealized 1D uniform flow case with MODFLOW\n",
    "- Run MT3D-USGS with proper grid resolution (Pe = 0.5)\n",
    "- Compare MT3D results to pulse source analytical solution\n",
    "- **Result:** Builds confidence that MT3D works correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Load Real Flow Model (Section 5)**\n",
    "- Load existing Limmat Valley MODFLOW model\n",
    "- Verify steady-state flow field\n",
    "- Prepare for transport coupling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Apply to 2.5D Limmat Valley (Section 6)**\n",
    "- Define point source location in real aquifer\n",
    "- Run MT3D on existing 50m grid (Pe = 5)\n",
    "- Observe numerical artifacts from coarse grid\n",
    "- **Result:** Understand limitations and when to refine\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6: Diagnose and Fix (Section 6.10 + Section 7)**\n",
    "- Diagnose why Pe = 5 causes problems\n",
    "- Introduce telescope approach for grid refinement\n",
    "- Achieve reliable results like Section 4\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Why This Structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical First:** Section 3 shows the \"correct\" answer from theory. Section 4 proves MT3D can reproduce it when properly configured. Without these baselines, we wouldn't know if Section 6 problems are bugs or numerical artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Controlled Comparison:** By keeping everything identical except grid resolution:\n",
    "- Section 4: Pe = 0.5 → excellent results ✓\n",
    "- Section 6: Pe = 5.0 → numerical issues ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "This teaches the critical lesson: **numerical modeling is more about proper setup than fancy software**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pedagogical Value:**\n",
    "- Students see analytical solution first (understand the physics)\n",
    "- Then verify MT3D can reproduce it (build confidence in tool)\n",
    "- Experience both success (Section 4) and failure (Section 6)\n",
    "- Learn to diagnose problems (Peclet number check)\n",
    "- Practice professional workflow: theory → analytical → verify → apply → diagnose → refine\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Learning Outcomes\n",

    "\n",
    "Contaminant transport in groundwater is governed by physical, chemical, and biological processes. Understanding these processes is essential for predicting plume migration, assessing risks, and designing remediation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Fundamental Transport Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advection** is the movement of dissolved contaminants with flowing groundwater:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u = \\frac{K \\cdot i}{\\phi_e}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $u$ is pore water velocity (m/day), $K$ is hydraulic conductivity (m/day), $i$ is hydraulic gradient (m/m), and $\\phi_e$ is effective porosity (dimensionless).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dispersion** causes spreading of the contaminant plume beyond what advection alone would predict. It results from:\n",
    "- **Mechanical dispersion**: Variations in velocity at pore scale and between flow paths\n",
    "- **Molecular diffusion**: Random motion of molecules (typically negligible compared to mechanical dispersion)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sorption** is the attachment of contaminants to aquifer solids, causing **retardation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = 1 + \\frac{(1-\\phi_e) \\cdot \\rho_s \\cdot K_s}{\\phi_e}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R$ is the retardation factor (dimensionless), $\\rho_s$ is bulk density (kg/m³), and $K_s$ is the distribution coefficient (mL/g).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decay** represents biodegradation or chemical transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c(t) = c_0 \\cdot e^{-\\lambda t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the first-order decay constant (1/day), related to half-life by $t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/\\lambda$.\n",

    "✓ **Mass balance is essential** - Always check mass conservation in `.mas` file  \n",

    "### Interpreting the Numerical Dispersion Diagnostics\n",

    "- **Pe ≤ 2**: Acceptable - Some numerical dispersion but manageable  \n",
    "- **Pe > 2**: Problematic - Numerical dispersion dominates physical dispersion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your model**: With 50m grid and αL = 10m → **Pe = 5.0** ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Concentration Overshoots**\n",
    "Physical transport cannot create concentrations higher than the source. If max(C) > C_source, this is a **numerical artifact** caused by:\n",
    "- Grid Peclet number violations (Pe > 2)\n",
    "- Improper time stepping (Courant number violations)\n",
    "- Numerical scheme limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Oscillations in Concentration Profiles**\n",
    "Smooth concentration gradients should not show rapid back-and-forth changes. Many oscillations indicate:\n",
    "- Numerical dispersion creating artificial spreading/sharpening\n",
    "- Grid resolution too coarse for concentration gradient\n",
    "- Scheme (TVD) struggling with sharp fronts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Numerical vs Physical Dispersion Ratio**\n",
    "Numerical dispersion acts like additional \"fake\" dispersivity:\n",
    "- **Ratio < 0.5**: Numerical effects are minor (< 50% of physical)\n",
    "- **Ratio 0.5-1.0**: Numerical effects are significant (50-100% of physical)  \n",
    "- **Ratio > 1.0**: Numerical dispersion DOMINATES - results unreliable!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your model**: Numerical ≈ 25m vs Physical = 10m → **Ratio = 2.5:1** ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Mass Balance**\n",
    "Check the `.MAS` file for:\n",
    "- Mass in system (should increase for continuous source)\n",
    "- Mass discrepancy (should be < 1%)\n",
    "- If discrepancy is large, suggests numerical problems\n",

    "- Need finer grid to resolve steep concentration changes\n",

    "\n",
    "### Solutions (in order of preference):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: Telescope/Nested Grid Approach** (RECOMMENDED - Section 8)\n",
    "- Keep 50m grid for regional flow (computationally efficient)\n",
    "- Create refined 5-10m submodel around source and critical areas\n",
    "- Achieves Pe ≤ 2 where it matters\n",
    "- Industry-standard approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: Increase Dispersivity** (NOT RECOMMENDED)\n",
    "- Could artificially increase αL to make Pe ≤ 2\n",
    "- But this falsifies the physics (wrong spreading rate)\n",
    "- Only acceptable if uncertainty in αL is very large\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 3: Accept Limitations**\n",
    "- Document that Pe = 5 → results are approximate\n",
    "- Use only for screening, not design/regulatory\n",
    "- Recommend refined modeling in final report\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 4: Compare with Analytical Solution**\n",
    "- Extract 1D transect along flow direction  \n",
    "- Compare with Ogata-Banks solution\n",
    "- Provides bounds on plume migration rate\n",

    "#### ❌ **Pitfall 1: \"Numerical is always better because it's more sophisticated\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reality**: Numerical models with poor data or wrong Pe number are WORSE than simple analytical with appropriate assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example from this notebook**:\n",
    "- Section 3 analytical: Trustworthy if 1D assumptions OK\n",
    "- Section 6 numerical (Pe=5): Artifacts, overshoots, NOT trustworthy\n",

    "**Lesson**: Complexity ≠ Accuracy. Match method to problem AND data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ **Pitfall 2: \"Analytical is too simple for real problems\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reality**: Many real sites DO meet analytical assumptions (uniform flow, single source, conservative tracer). Analytical can be perfectly defensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: BIOSCREEN (analytical 1D model with decay) is EPA-accepted for monitored natural attenuation assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson**: Don't build complexity you can't justify with data.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ **Pitfall 3: \"Skipping verification because numerical model is complex\"**\n",

    "**Reality**: Complex models have MORE potential for error, not less. Verification is even more critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example from this notebook**:\n",
    "- Section 4 verification caught that we needed Pe ≤ 2\n",
    "- Without verification, we might trust Section 6's Pe=5 results\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ **Pitfall 4: \"Using particle tracking for concentration predictions\"**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Example misuse**: \"MODPATH shows contamination reaches well in 5 years, so concentration will be X.\"\n",

    "**The Problem We've Identified**:\n",
    "- Section 6 showed transport on 50m grid → Pe = 5.0 → unreliable\n",
    "- We need Pe ≤ 2 for accuracy → requires Δx ≤ 20m (better: 5-10m)\n",

    "**The Solution: Telescope Approach** (Section 8)\n",
    "1. **Regional model** (parent): 50m grid, defines flow field\n",
    "2. **Local submodel**: 5-10m grid around source and wells\n",
    "3. **Boundary coupling**: Extract heads from parent, apply to submodel boundaries\n",
    "4. **Run transport on submodel**: Achieves Pe ≤ 2 where it matters\n",

    "#### **Question 1: Data-Model Complexity Mismatch**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A consultant proposes a 3D MT3D model with 1-meter grid cells for a 10 km² aquifer. The data consists of 3 monitoring wells with one water quality sample each. Is this appropriate? Why or why not?**\n",

    "**Answer: NO, this is not appropriate. This is a classic case of overmodeling.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems with this approach**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insufficient data**: 3 wells with 1 sample each cannot constrain a high-resolution 3D model\n",
    "   - 10 km² at 1m resolution = 10,000,000 cells in 2D, multiply by layers for 3D\n",
    "   - 3 data points cannot calibrate or validate millions of cells\n",
    "   - Parameter uncertainty will be enormous\n",

    "2. **Computational overkill**: \n",
    "   - Model will take hours to days to run\n",
    "   - Results will appear precise but actually highly uncertain\n",
    "   - False sense of accuracy (\"looks sophisticated, must be right\")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Grid resolution unjustified**:\n",
    "   - Pe ≤ 2 requires Δx ≤ 2αL\n",
    "   - With Δx = 1m, αL must be 0.5-1m (lab scale!)\n",
    "   - At 10 km² regional scale, typical αL = 50-100m\n",
    "   - Pe = 1m / 50m = 0.02 (wasteful overrefinement)\n",

    "- Perform **sensitivity analysis** to show range of predictions given data uncertainty\n",

    "2. **Verify decay separately**:\n",
    "   - Run 1D model with decay (λ > 0), no sorption\n",
    "   - Compare to analytical with exponential decay: C(t) = C₀·exp(-λt)\n",
    "   - Concentration should decrease exponentially\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify combined effects** (if both active):\n",
    "   - Compare to analytical with both R and λ\n",
    "   - Check that retardation doesn't affect decay rate (should decay at λ, not λ/R)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key lesson**: Verification must cover ALL active processes. Verifying advection-dispersion does NOT verify reactions!\n",

    "**Reference**: Section 4 verified advection-dispersion only. Section 6.4 introduced RCT but didn't verify it separately.\n",

    "## 8. Telescope Approach: Solving the Grid Resolution Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1 Recap: The Problem We Need to Solve\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 6, we implemented transport on the Limmat Valley parent model with 50m cells:\n",
    "- **Result**: Pe = 5.0 → numerical artifacts, overshoots, unreliable concentrations\n",
    "- **Diagnosis (Section 6.10)**: Grid too coarse for transport (need Pe ≤ 2)\n",
    "- **Requirement**: To achieve Pe ≤ 2 with αL = 10m, we need Δx ≤ 20m (better: 5-10m)\n",
    "\n",
    "**But there's a problem**:\n",
    "- Refining the **entire** Limmat Valley model from 50m to 5m would create:\n",
    "  - ~100× more cells (20,000+ cells instead of ~200)\n",
    "  - ~100× longer computation time\n",
    "  - Huge output files\n",
    "  - **Most importantly**: Unnecessary refinement far from the source area!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The solution**: **Telescope approach** (also called \"nested grid\" or \"local grid refinement\")\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.2 What is the Telescope Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "The telescope approach is a **hybrid modeling strategy** that combines:\n",
    "1. **Coarse regional model** (parent) → Defines large-scale flow field\n",
    "2. **Refined local model** (child/submodel) → High resolution where it matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: Like using a telescope:\n",
    "- **Wide-angle lens** (parent model): See the whole landscape at low resolution\n",
    "- **Telephoto zoom** (submodel): Focus on one area with high resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "**In groundwater transport**:\n",
    "- **Parent model**: 50m grid, captures regional flow (Limmat River, recharge, valley boundaries)\n",
    "- **Submodel**: 5-10m grid around source/wells, captures sharp concentration gradients\n",
    "- **Coupling**: Extract boundary conditions (heads) from parent → apply to submodel edges\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.3 When is Telescope Approach Appropriate?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use telescope approach when**:\n",
    "- **Localized interest area**: Source, well field, or critical receptor occupies small portion of domain\n",
    "- **Regional context matters**: Need regional flow field (rivers, boundaries) but local detail too\n",
    "- **Pe number violation**: Parent grid too coarse for transport (Pe > 2) but appropriate for flow\n",
    "- **Computational efficiency**: Can't afford to refine entire domain to transport-appropriate resolution\n",
    "- **Regulatory acceptance**: Widely accepted in professional practice\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Common applications**:\n",
    "- Well capture zones (pumping well in regional aquifer)\n",
    "- Point source contamination (spill in large model)\n",
    "- Monitoring well network optimization\n",
    "- Remediation system design (pump-and-treat, PRBs)\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **NOT appropriate when**:\n",
    "- Plume extends across entire domain (no localized area of interest)\n",
    "- Regional flow field is too uncertain (large parent model errors)\n",
    "- Boundary conditions vary rapidly (strong transients at submodel edges)\n",
    "- Multiple widely-separated areas of interest (need multiple submodels or full refinement)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.4 Telescope Approach Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Run parent model** (we did this in Section 5)\n",
    "- Coarse grid (e.g., 50m cells)\n",

    "- Add buffer (ensure plume doesn't reach submodel boundaries)\n",
    "- Typically 500m - 2km on each side of source\n",

    "**Step 3: Create refined submodel grid**\n",
    "- Fine resolution (5-10m cells) within submodel domain\n",
    "- Aligned with parent grid (usually)\n",
    "- Same vertical discretization (layer thicknesses)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Interpolate aquifer properties**\n",
    "- Transfer K, bottom elevations, porosity from parent → submodel\n",
    "- If parent has zones, assign same properties to refined cells in each zone\n",

    "- **Specified Head (CHD)**: Read heads from parent model at submodel perimeter\n",
    "- Apply as CHD boundaries on submodel edges\n",
    "- Alternatively: **GHB** (General Head Boundary) if conductance is known\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6: Run submodel flow**\n",
    "- Steady-state (using parent's steady heads) or transient (if parent is transient)\n",
    "- Check mass balance, verify continuity with parent\n",
    "- Heads at submodel boundaries should match parent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 7: Run transport on submodel**\n",
    "- Check Pe number (should be ≤ 2 now!)\n",
    "- Check Courant number (may need smaller time steps with finer grid)\n",
    "- Run MT3D on refined submodel\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 8: Post-process and compare**\n",
    "- Compare refined submodel results to coarse parent transport (Section 6)\n",

    "### 8.6 Key Considerations for Telescope Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.6.1 Boundary Condition Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: Specified Head (CHD)**\n",
    "- Extract heads from parent at submodel perimeter\n",
    "- Apply as fixed head boundaries\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Simple, no additional parameters\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Assumes parent heads are exact (no flow interaction)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: General Head Boundary (GHB)**\n",
    "- Allows two-way flow exchange (in/out of submodel)\n",
    "- Requires conductance parameter\n",
    "- **Advantages**: More flexible, better for transient conditions\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Need to estimate conductance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 3: Specified Flux (WEL or FHB)**\n",
    "- Extract fluxes from parent, apply as sources/sinks at boundary\n",
    "- **Advantages**: Mass balance preserved\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Complex setup, may cause convergence issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most common in practice**: CHD or GHB\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.6.2 Buffer Zone Sizing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule of thumb**: Submodel boundaries should be far enough from area of interest that:\n",
    "- Boundary conditions don't artificially constrain plume\n",
    "- Transport doesn't reach boundaries during simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "**For our 10-year simulation**:\n",
    "- Estimate maximum plume travel: distance = v × t = (0.1 m/day) × (3650 days) ≈ 365m\n",
    "- Add safety factor: 500m buffer\n",
    "- Check during post-processing: Did plume reach boundaries? If yes, expand submodel!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8.6.3 Grid Resolution Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Criteria**:\n",
    "1. **Peclet number**: Δx ≤ 2αL (for Pe ≤ 2)\n",
    "   - With αL = 10m → Δx ≤ 20m\n",
    "   - Better: Δx = 5-10m (Pe = 0.5-1.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Courant number**: Cr = v·Δt/(n·Δx) ≤ 1\n",
    "   - Finer grid → need smaller time steps!\n",
    "   - With Δx = 10m, v = 0.1 m/day, n = 0.25 → Δt ≤ 25 days (satisfied for MT3D default)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computational budget**: Balance resolution vs runtime\n",
    "   - 5m cells → most accurate but 4× longer than 10m\n",
    "   - 10m cells → good compromise\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Alignment with parent**: Often helpful (not required) to make submodel cell size an integer divisor of parent\n",
    "   - Parent 50m → submodel 10m (5:1 ratio)\n",
    "   - Parent 50m → submodel 5m (10:1 ratio)\n",

    "### 8.7 Advantages and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ **Advantages of Telescope Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computational efficiency**: Refine only where needed (10-100× faster than full refinement)\n",
    "2. **Accuracy where it matters**: Achieve Pe ≤ 2 near source/wells without refining entire domain\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: Can create multiple submodels for different areas of interest\n",
    "4. **Regional context preserved**: Parent model captures large-scale features (rivers, boundaries)\n",
    "5. **Industry standard**: Widely accepted in regulatory and consulting practice\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ **Limitations and Assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One-way coupling**: Submodel doesn't affect parent (assumes submodel is \"small\" relative to parent)\n",
    "   - OK if: Submodel pumping << total regional flow\n",
    "   - NOT OK if: Large well field significantly changes regional heads\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Boundary condition uncertainty**: Submodel inherits any parent model errors at boundaries\n",
    "   - Need confidence in parent model calibration\n",
    "   - Errors at boundaries propagate inward (but decay with distance)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Setup complexity**: More involved than single-model approach\n",
    "   - Need to extract boundaries, interpolate properties, verify coupling\n",
    "   - Potential for errors in domain transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Transient complications**: If parent is transient, need time-varying boundary conditions for submodel\n",

    "- No negative concentrations\n",
    "- No artificial oscillations\n",

    "✅ **Boundary effects**:\n",
    "- Plume doesn't reach submodel boundaries (or concentration << source concentration at boundary)\n",
    "- If plume reaches boundary, expand submodel domain!\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Comparison with parent**:\n",
    "- Extract same transect from coarse (Section 6) and refined (Section 8) models\n",

    "- **Advection**: Movement with groundwater flow (dominant at field scale)\n",
    "- **Dispersion**: Mechanical mixing + molecular diffusion (αL, αT, αV)\n",
    "- **Sorption**: Contaminant-solid partitioning (Kd, retardation factor R)\n",
    "- **Decay**: Biodegradation or chemical transformation (λ, half-life)\n",
    "- **Source terms**: How contaminants enter the system (forcing terms, boundary conditions)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: Different processes dominate at different scales and for different contaminants.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Analytical Solutions (Section 3)**\n",
    "- **Ogata-Banks solution**: 1D advection-dispersion with continuous source\n",
    "- **Parameter exploration**: Sensitivity to v, D, αL, source concentration\n",
    "- **Physical interpretation**: Breakthrough curves, concentration profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: Analytical solutions provide \"ground truth\" for simple cases and are essential for verification.\n",

    "#### **3. Numerical Verification (Section 4)**\n",
    "- **MT3D-USGS setup**: Complete package workflow (BTN, ADV, DSP, SSM, GCG)\n",
    "- **Grid design for verification**: Pe = 0.5 ensures numerical accuracy\n",
    "- **Comparison with analytical**: <10% error when properly configured\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: Numerical models must be verified against known solutions. Never trust an unverified model!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Real-World Application (Sections 5-6)**\n",
    "- **Limmat Valley transport**: 2.5D transport on real aquifer geometry\n",
    "- **Source term implementation**: Constant concentration cells (icbund=-1)\n",
    "- **Coarse grid consequences**: Pe = 5.0 → numerical artifacts, overshoots\n",
    "- **Diagnosis (Section 6.10)**: Understanding why Pe number matters\n",

    "**Key insight**: Just because a model runs doesn't mean results are trustworthy. Always check Pe number!\n",
