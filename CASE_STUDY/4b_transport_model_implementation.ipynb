    "## 1. Overview: Learning Path for Contaminant Transport Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to add contaminant transport processes to an existing groundwater flow model. We follow a systematic approach that builds confidence through verification before tackling complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 The Problem: Contaminant Plume Migration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** A point source releases contaminants into the Limmat Valley aquifer. We need to predict:\n",
    "- How far will the plume migrate?\n",
    "- What concentrations will reach downstream locations?\n",
    "- Can we trust our numerical model predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The Approach: Simple to Complex\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than immediately jumping to a complex 2.5D Limmat Valley model, we follow professional best practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Learn the Theory (Section 2)**\n",
    "- Understand transport processes (advection, dispersion, reactions)\n",
    "- Learn the governing equations with forcing terms\n",
    "- Understand how MT3D-USGS couples with MODFLOW\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Verify with Analytical Solution (Section 3)**\n",
    "- Implement Ogata-Banks analytical solution for 1D transport\n",
    "- Understand what the \"correct\" answer should look like\n",
    "- Test the analytical solution with different parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Verify MT3D with 1D Test (Section 4)**\n",
    "- Create idealized 1D uniform flow case with MODFLOW\n",
    "- Run MT3D-USGS with proper grid resolution (Pe = 0.5)\n",
    "- Compare MT3D results to Ogata-Banks analytical solution\n",
    "- **Result:** Builds confidence that MT3D works correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Load Real Flow Model (Section 5)**\n",
    "- Load existing Limmat Valley MODFLOW model\n",
    "- Verify steady-state flow field\n",
    "- Prepare for transport coupling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5: Apply to 2.5D Limmat Valley (Section 6)**\n",
    "- Define point source location in real aquifer\n",
    "- Run MT3D on existing 50m grid (Pe = 5)\n",
    "- Observe numerical artifacts from coarse grid\n",
    "- **Result:** Understand limitations and when to refine\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6: Diagnose and Fix (Section 6.10 + Section 7)**\n",
    "- Diagnose why Pe = 5 causes problems\n",
    "- Introduce telescope approach for grid refinement\n",
    "- Achieve reliable results like Section 4\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Why This Structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical First:** Section 3 shows the \"correct\" answer from theory. Section 4 proves MT3D can reproduce it when properly configured. Without these baselines, we wouldn't know if Section 6 problems are bugs or numerical artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Controlled Comparison:** By keeping everything identical except grid resolution:\n",
    "- Section 4: Pe = 0.5 → excellent results ✓\n",
    "- Section 6: Pe = 5.0 → numerical issues ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "This teaches the critical lesson: **numerical modeling is more about proper setup than fancy software**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pedagogical Value:**\n",
    "- Students see analytical solution first (understand the physics)\n",
    "- Then verify MT3D can reproduce it (build confidence in tool)\n",
    "- Experience both success (Section 4) and failure (Section 6)\n",
    "- Learn to diagnose problems (Peclet number check)\n",
    "- Practice professional workflow: theory → analytical → verify → apply → diagnose → refine\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Introduction to Contaminant Transport Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Contaminant transport in groundwater is governed by physical, chemical, and biological processes. Understanding these processes is essential for predicting plume migration, assessing risks, and designing remediation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Fundamental Transport Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advection** is the movement of dissolved contaminants with flowing groundwater:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v = \\frac{K \\cdot i}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v$ is pore water velocity (m/day), $K$ is hydraulic conductivity (m/day), $i$ is hydraulic gradient (m/m), and $n$ is effective porosity (dimensionless).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dispersion** causes spreading of the contaminant plume beyond what advection alone would predict. It results from:\n",
    "- **Mechanical dispersion**: Variations in velocity at pore scale and between flow paths\n",
    "- **Molecular diffusion**: Random motion of molecules (typically negligible compared to mechanical dispersion)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sorption** is the attachment of contaminants to aquifer solids, causing **retardation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = 1 + \\frac{\\rho_b \\cdot K_d}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R$ is the retardation factor (dimensionless), $\\rho_b$ is bulk density (kg/m³), and $K_d$ is the distribution coefficient (mL/g).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decay** represents biodegradation or chemical transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C(t) = C_0 \\cdot e^{-\\lambda t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the first-order decay constant (1/day), related to half-life by $t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Governing Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3D advection-dispersion-reaction equation describes contaminant transport:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (D \\nabla C) - \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla C - \\lambda C\n",

    "### 2.3 Formulation of the Transport Problem with Forcing Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complete Transport Equation with Sources/Sinks\n",
    "\n",
    "The **full form** of the transport equation includes **forcing terms** (sources and sinks):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (D \\nabla C) - \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{v} C) - \\lambda R C + \\frac{q_s C_s}{n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the **forcing term** $\\frac{q_s C_s}{n}$ represents:\n",
    "- $q_s$ = volumetric flow rate per unit volume of aquifer (1/day) - positive for injection, negative for extraction\n",
    "- $C_s$ = concentration in the source/sink water (kg/m³)\n",
    "- $n$ = porosity (dimensionless)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Physical Interpretation of Forcing Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Point Sources (Constant Concentration)**\n",
    "- Continuous spill or leak\n",
    "- Implemented as: **Dirichlet boundary condition** $C(x_s, y_s, z_s, t) = C_0$\n",

    "- General head boundaries: SSM with `itype = 5` (GHB package)\n",

    "| Well flow | m³/day | m³/day | - |\n",
    "| Mass rate | - | kg/day | - |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example conversions:**\n",
    "- 100 mg/L = 0.1 kg/m³\n",
    "- 1 g/L = 1 kg/m³\n",
    "- Well at 1000 m³/day with 50 mg/L → injects 0.05 kg/day of mass\n",

    "   - Step 3: Reactions (analytical or implicit)\n",
    "   - Step 4: Sources/sinks (SSM package)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Coupling with MODFLOW**:\n",

    "   - Boundaries (rivers, drains, GHB)\n",
    "   - Decay/reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Takeaways for Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ **Sources must be properly configured** - Wrong unit conversions → wrong results  \n",
    "✓ **Well injection ≠ constant concentration** - Different mathematical formulations  \n",
    "✓ **Mass balance is essential** - Always check mass conservation in `.mas` file  \n",
    "✓ **Boundary conditions matter** - Plumes must stay within domain or have proper BCs  \n",
    "✓ **Forcing terms are additive** - Multiple sources sum together in the equation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next section** covers analytical vs. numerical solutions, where we'll see how forcing terms appear in analytical solutions (e.g., Ogata-Banks uses a constant concentration source at x=0).\n",

    "### 2.4 Analytical vs. Numerical Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical solutions** exist for simplified conditions (1D, uniform flow, simple boundaries). **Example**: Ogata-Banks solution for 1D continuous source:\n",

    "1. **Understand the physics** - Analytical solution shows pure advection-dispersion\n",
    "2. **Know the \"correct\" answer** - This is our benchmark for verification\n",

    "1. **Build confidence** - Verify MT3D physics are correct\n",

    "3. **Test workflow** - Debug setup issues in simple context\n",
