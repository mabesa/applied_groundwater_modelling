    "## 1. Introduction to Contaminant Transport Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Contaminant transport in groundwater is governed by physical, chemical, and biological processes. Understanding these processes is essential for predicting plume migration, assessing risks, and designing remediation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Fundamental Transport Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advection** is the movement of dissolved contaminants with flowing groundwater:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v = \\frac{K \\cdot i}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v$ is pore water velocity (m/day), $K$ is hydraulic conductivity (m/day), $i$ is hydraulic gradient (m/m), and $n$ is effective porosity (dimensionless).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dispersion** causes spreading of the contaminant plume beyond what advection alone would predict. It results from:\n",
    "- **Mechanical dispersion**: Variations in velocity at pore scale and between flow paths\n",
    "- **Molecular diffusion**: Random motion of molecules (typically negligible compared to mechanical dispersion)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sorption** is the attachment of contaminants to aquifer solids, causing **retardation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = 1 + \\frac{\\rho_b \\cdot K_d}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R$ is the retardation factor (dimensionless), $\\rho_b$ is bulk density (kg/m³), and $K_d$ is the distribution coefficient (mL/g).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decay** represents biodegradation or chemical transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C(t) = C_0 \\cdot e^{-\\lambda t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the first-order decay constant (1/day), related to half-life by $t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Governing Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3D advection-dispersion-reaction equation describes contaminant transport:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (D \\nabla C) - \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla C - \\lambda C\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $C$ = concentration (mg/L)\n",
    "- $t$ = time (days)\n",
    "- $D$ = dispersion tensor (m²/day)\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{v}$ = velocity vector (m/day)\n",
    "- $\\lambda$ = decay constant (1/day)\n",
    "\n",
    "For reactive transport, multiply $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}$ by retardation factor $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Analytical vs. Numerical Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical solutions** exist for simplified conditions (1D, uniform flow, simple boundaries). **Example**: Ogata-Banks solution for 1D continuous source:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C(x,t) = \\frac{C_0}{2}\\left[\\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x-vt}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right) + e^{vx/D}\\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{x+vt}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numerical solutions** (MT3D-USGS, MODFLOW 6 GWT) handle complex 2D/3D geometries, heterogeneity, wells, and boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 MT3D-USGS: Modular Transport Simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "MT3D-USGS (Bedekar et al., 2016) is the USGS version of MT3DMS, coupled with MODFLOW. It uses a **modular package structure**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Package | Purpose | Key Parameters |\n",

    "| **BTN** | Basic Transport | Porosity, initial concentration, time steps |\n",
    "| **ADV** | Advection | Numerical scheme (MOC, TVD, etc.) |\n",

    "| **RCT** | Reactions | Sorption ($K_d$), decay ($\\lambda$) |\n",
    "| **GCG** | Solver | Convergence criteria |\n",

    "### 1.5 When to Use Which Method?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Simple problem? → Try analytical first\n",
    "├─ Uniform flow, 1D, no wells → Ogata-Banks\n",

    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "- **Verification is essential**: Always compare to analytical solutions when possible\n",
    "- **Start simple**: Don't jump to complexity without justification\n",
    "- **Resolution matters**: Transport needs finer grids than flow\n",
    "- **Stability criteria**: Check Courant and Peclet numbers\n",
    "- **Mass balance**: Always verify mass conservation\n",
    "- **Physical reasonableness**: Do results make sense given flow field and sources?\n",

    "### Transport Case Study Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Task:**\n",
    "Each group will model contaminant transport in the Limmat Valley with well field interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow:**\n",
    "1. Load fresh base parent model (independent from flow case)\n",
    "2. Load well locations from your flow case study\n",
    "3. Create transport telescope submodel around wells and source\n",
    "4. Set up MODFLOW submodel with wells (steady-state flow)\n",
    "5. Set up MT3DMS for transient transport\n",
    "6. Define contaminant source (scenario-specific)\n",
    "7. Run 10-year transport simulation\n",
    "8. Analyze well-contaminant interactions (capture/spreading)\n",
    "9. **MANDATORY: Analytical verification** (Tier 1 or Tier 2)\n",
    "10. Write professional report (3-4 pages)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences from Flow Case:**\n",
    "- ✅ **Simpler workflow**: No scenario variations, just transport + wells\n",
    "- ✅ **Independent**: Uses fresh base model, not your flow results\n",
    "- ✅ **Wells reused**: Load from case_config.yaml, don't reimplement\n",
    "- ✅ **Focus**: Well-contaminant interactions (capture zones, spreading)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenarios by Group:**\n",
    "- Group 0: TCE industrial spill (demo)\n",
    "- Group 1: Nitrate from sports field fertilizer\n",
    "- Group 2: Chloride from legacy landfill\n",
    "- Group 3: Benzene from gas station (with decay)\n",
    "- Group 4: Atrazine from garden allotments (with sorption)\n",
    "- Group 5: PFOA industrial point source\n",
    "- Group 6: PCE from dry cleaning facility\n",
    "- Group 7: Ammonium from leaking sewer (with decay)\n",
    "- Group 8: Chromium from metal plating (with sorption)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Comparison (MANDATORY):**\n",
    "- **Tier 1** (Groups 0,1,2,5,6): Full Ogata-Banks 1D comparison\n",
    "- **Tier 2** (Groups 3,4,7,8): Choose simplified comparison or justification\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables:**\n",
    "1. Completed `case_config_transport.yaml` with justified parameters\n",
    "2. Executed notebook with all results\n",
    "3. Professional report (3-4 pages PDF)\n",
    "4. Analytical comparison section\n",
    "5. Well-contaminant interaction analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Estimate:** ~10 hours total\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "1. Review your transport scenario in `case_config_transport.yaml`\n",
    "2. Study the demo notebook for Group 0\n",
    "3. Adapt the demo to your contaminant and well configuration\n",
    "4. Run simulations and verify results\n",
    "5. Complete analytical comparison\n",
    "6. Write professional report\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "- **SUPPORT_REPO**: Analytical solution functions, plotting templates\n",
    "- **Demo notebook**: Complete working example (Group 0)\n",
