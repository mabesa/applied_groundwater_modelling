    "\n",
    "Contaminant transport in groundwater is governed by physical, chemical, and biological processes. Understanding these processes is essential for predicting plume migration, assessing risks, and designing remediation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Fundamental Transport Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advection** is the movement of dissolved contaminants with flowing groundwater:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u = \\frac{K \\cdot i}{\\phi_e}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $u$ is pore water velocity (m/day), $K$ is hydraulic conductivity (m/day), $i$ is hydraulic gradient (m/m), and $\\phi_e$ is effective porosity (dimensionless).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dispersion** causes spreading of the contaminant plume beyond what advection alone would predict. It results from:\n",
    "- **Mechanical dispersion**: Variations in velocity at pore scale and between flow paths\n",
    "- **Molecular diffusion**: Random motion of molecules (typically negligible compared to mechanical dispersion)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sorption** is the attachment of contaminants to aquifer solids, causing **retardation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R = 1 + \\frac{(1-\\phi_e) \\cdot \\rho_s \\cdot K_s}{\\phi_e}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R$ is the retardation factor (dimensionless), $\\rho_s$ is solid density (kg/m³), and $K_s$ is the distribution coefficient (mL/g).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decay** represents biodegradation or chemical transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c(t) = c_0 \\cdot e^{-\\lambda t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the first-order decay constant (1/day), related to half-life by $t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Governing Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3D advection-dispersion-reaction equation describes contaminant transport:\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the **forcing term** $\\frac{q_s c_s}{\\phi_e}$ represents:\n",
    "- $q_s$ = volumetric flow rate per unit volume of aquifer (1/day) - positive for injection, negative for extraction\n",

    "### 2.7 A Note on Grid Resolution and the numerical Peclet Number\n",
    "When using numerical methods like MT3D, grid resolution is critical for accurate transport modeling. The **numerical Peclet number (Pe)** is a dimensionless number that helps us assess whether our grid is fine enough:\n",

    "- $\\alpha_L$ is the longitudinal dispersivity [L]\n",
    " \n",
    "**Rule of thumb**: Keep Pe ≤ 2 (ideally ≤ 1) to avoid numerical dispersion artifacts. This means your grid cells should be smaller than or equal to 2 times the dispersivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $\\alpha_L = 20$ m, then $\\Delta x \\leq 40$ m (better if $\\Delta x \\leq 20$ m)\n",
    "- Smaller dispersivity requires finer grids\n",
    "- Around wells or sources, local grid refinement is often needed\n",

    "1. **Understand the physics** - Analytical solution shows pure advection-dispersion\n",
    "2. **Know the \"correct\" answer** - This is our benchmark for verification\n",

    "There are multiple options to define a contaminant source in MT3D-USGS. Below, we discuss two common approaches for defining a continuous source.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Continuous Source Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For continuous releases (industrial discharge, wastewater outfall, ongoing contamination), we define a constant concentration or constant mass loading rate at the source location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two Approaches for Continuous Sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: Constant Concentration Source (icbund = -1)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use when you know the concentration at the source (e.g., effluent discharge at fixed concentration)\n",
    "- Set icbund[source_cell] = -1 to maintain constant concentration\n",
    "- MT3D will automatically inject/remove mass to maintain this concentration\n",
    "- Mass balance file shows cumulative mass added\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 2: Constant Mass Flux via SSM Package**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use when you know the mass loading rate (e.g., 10 kg/day)\n",
    "- Use Source-Sink Mixing (SSM) package to inject constant mass\n",
    "- Can link to MODFLOW stresses (wells, rivers) or inject directly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation for Option 1 (Constant Concentration):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define source concentration: C_source (kg/m³ or mg/L)\n",
    "- Set boundary condition: icbund[source_cell] = -1\n",
    "- Set initial concentration: sconc[source_cell] = C_source\n",
    "- Transport occurs: concentration maintained at source, plume spreads downgradient\n",
    "Eventually reaches steady-state (if domain is large enough)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation for Option 2 (Constant Mass Flux):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define mass loading rate: M_rate (kg/day)\n",
    "- Keep icbund[source_cell] = 1 (active cell)\n",
    "- Set initial concentration: sconc[source_cell] = 0 (or background)\n",
    "- Use SSM package to inject mass at constant rate\n",
    "- Concentration at source varies based on mass balance\n",
    "\n",
    "This differs from an instantaneous source which releases all mass at t=0 and then decays away.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physical meaning (Option 1):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- t=0: Source concentration = C_source, rest of domain = 0\n",
    "- t>0: Plume grows, concentration maintained at source\n",
    "- t→∞: Steady-state plume (if boundary conditions allow)\n",
    "- Total mass in system increases over time until steady-state\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we'll demonstrate Option 1 (constant concentration) as it's simpler and more commonly used for industrial discharge scenarios."

    "## 7. Telescope Approach: Solving the Grid Resolution Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 Recap: The Problem We Need to Solve\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we learned from verification (Section 4):**\n",
    "- With fine grid (Δx = 5m, αL = 10m) → Pe = 0.5 → Excellent agreement with analytical solution ✓\n",
    "- This established our target: **Pe ≤ 2 for accurate transport modeling**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we face in practice (Section 5):**\n",
    "- Limmat Valley parent model has Δx = 50m grid cells\n",
    "- For transport with αL = 10m → Pe = 50/10 = 5.0\n",
    "- **Problem**: Pe = 5.0 > 2 → Grid too coarse for accurate contaminant transport\n",
    "- **Requirement**: To achieve Pe ≤ 2, we need Δx ≤ 20m (ideally 5-10m for Pe ≤ 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why we can't just refine the entire model:**\n",
    "- Refining the entire Limmat Valley to 10m cells would create ~40,000 cells (was 1,000)\n",
    "- Simulation time would increase by 40× or more\n",
    "- Most of the domain doesn't need fine resolution\n",
    "- We only need detail around the contaminant source and wells\n",
    "\n",
    "**The solution: Telescope (local grid refinement)**\n",
    "- Create a small refined \"child\" model extracted from the parent\n",
    "- Use fine grid (5-10m) only where needed → Pe ≤ 1\n",
    "- Inherit boundary conditions from the parent model\n",
    "- Keep most of the domain at coarse resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 What is the Telescope Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "The telescope approach creates a nested \"child\" model with:\n",
    "1. **Fine grid** in the area of interest (e.g., 10m cells around wells)\n",
    "2. **Inherits boundary conditions** from the coarse parent model\n",
    "3. **Much smaller domain** - only the refined area\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Like using a telescope to zoom in on one part of the sky while the wide-angle view provides context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.3 When is Telescope Approach Appropriate?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use telescope refinement when:**\n",
    "- You need fine resolution in a localized area (wells, sources)\n",
    "- Regional model is too coarse for local processes\n",
    "- Refining the entire model would be too large\n",
    "- Regional flow field is relatively smooth (not highly variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't use telescope if:**\n",
    "- You need fine resolution everywhere\n",
    "- Strong heterogeneity at regional scale affects local flow\n",
    "- Multiple widely-separated areas need refinement (consider multiple submodels)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.4 Telescope Approach Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Run parent (regional) flow model at coarse resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Extract boundary conditions along submodel perimeter from parent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Create child submodel with:\n",
    "- Fine grid around area of interest\n",
    "- Specified head or flux BC from parent\n",
    "- Same hydraulic properties (interpolated to fine grid)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** Run child flow model, verify it matches parent at boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5:** Add transport to child model with fine grid\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6:** Analyze transport results with confidence in grid resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.5 Conceptual Example: Our Limmat Valley Case\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parent model:**\n",
    "- Domain: 7 km × 7 km\n",
    "- Grid: 50m cells → 142 × 142 × 3 layers = ~60,000 cells\n",
    "- Purpose: Regional flow field\n",
    "\n",
    "**Child submodel (around source/wells):**\n",
    "- Domain: 1 km × 1 km\n",
    "- Grid: 10m cells → 100 × 100 × 3 layers = 30,000 cells\n",
    "- Purpose: Transport modeling with Pe = 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** Fine resolution where needed, manageable model size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.6 Key Considerations for Telescope Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.6.1 Boundary Condition Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "- **Specified head (CHD)**: Use parent head along submodel boundary\n",
    "- **Specified flux (WEL)**: Use parent flux across boundaries\n",
    "- **General head boundary (GHB)**: Allows some flow interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best practice:** Specified head is simplest and most stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.6.2 Buffer Zone Sizing\n",
    "\n",
    "The submodel should extend beyond your area of interest:\n",
    "- **Minimum:** Plume extent + 200m buffer\n",
    "- **Better:** Capture zone of wells + 300-500m buffer\n",
    "- **Principle:** Don't let the plume reach the boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.6.3 Grid Resolution Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose child grid size based on:\n",
    "- **Dispersivity:** Δx ≤ 2 × αL (keep Pe ≤ 2)\n",
    "- **Source/well size:** Multiple cells per well\n",
    "- **Computational limits:** Balance accuracy vs runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.7 Advantages and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**  \n",
    "✅ Fine resolution where needed  \n",
    "✅ Manageable model size  \n",
    "✅ Leverages regional model results  \n",
    "✅ Standard practice in consulting  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**  \n",
    "⚠️ Assumes parent flow field is accurate  \n",
    "⚠️ Boundary conditions are fixed (no feedback to parent)  \n",
    "⚠️ Requires careful boundary placement  \n",
    "⚠️ Property interpolation from parent to child  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.8 Verification and Quality Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the submodel, verify:\n",
    "1. **Head continuity:** Child heads match parent at boundaries\n",
    "2. **Flow continuity:** Flow directions consistent between models\n",
    "3. **Mass balance:** Check submodel water balance\n",
    "4. **Grid resolution:** Verify Pe ≤ 2 in transport areas\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.9 Looking Ahead: Your Transport Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "For your case study, you will:\n",
    "1. Use the parent Limmat Valley flow model (provided)\n",
    "2. Create a telescope submodel around your assigned wells\n",
    "3. Implement transport with appropriate grid resolution\n",
    "4. Analyze contaminant migration and well capture\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is a professional workflow** used in consulting projects worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.10 Summary: Why Telescope Approach Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The telescope approach is **essential** for practical transport modeling:\n",
    "- Solves the grid resolution challenge\n",
