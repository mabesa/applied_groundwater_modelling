    "The Limmat valley aquifer is a well-studied groundwater reservoir beneath the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Doppler and colleagues write, that it was formed during the last ice age, when the Lindt glacier retreated. The Limmat valley aquifer has no direct hydraulic connection to lake Zurich in the east where it is bound by impermeable lake sediments and moraine material. The aquifer is further confined in the north and south by the side morains of the Lindth glacier. Lateral inflow of groundwater from the hills in the north and south is to be expected. The groundwater body is further in connection with the river Sihl in the east and thr river Limmat in the north. The hydraulic properties of the aquifer are higly heterogenic because of its complex geological history formed through various sedimentation and erosion events from the rivers Sihl and Limmat.
