    "At this point, you’ve shaped a solid perceptual understanding of the system.

This is where scientific intuition meets structured representation.\n",

    "- **Analytical models**: Use these for simple, well-defined problems where you can derive a solution mathematically. They are fast and transparent but limited to specific conditions.\n",
    "- **Conceptual models**: Great for conceptualizing flow and transport in a simplified manner, especially when you can assume uniform conditions across a region. Commonly used in water balance studies.\n",
    "- **Time series models**: Ideal for problems where you have good historical data and want to predict future conditions at the observation location, based on past trends. They are useful for forecasting but may not capture spatial variability.\n",
