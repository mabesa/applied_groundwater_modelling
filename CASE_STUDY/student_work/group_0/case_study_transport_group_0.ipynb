    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "A 30-day trichloroethylene (TCE) spill from an industrial facility has contaminated the groundwater in the Limmat Valley. Your task is to:\n",
    "1. Model the transport of TCE through the aquifer over a 10-year period\n",
    "2. Analyze how the existing well field (pumping and injection wells) affects plume migration\n",
    "3. Assess whether contamination reaches the Limmat River or compliance monitoring points\n",
    "4. **(Optional for bonus credit)** Verify your numerical model against analytical solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "By completing this case study, you will:\n",
    "- Set up a coupled MODFLOW-MT3DMS transport model\n",
    "- Apply the telescope approach to refine resolution around source and wells\n",
    "- Define contaminant source terms using the SSM package\n",
    "- Analyze well-contaminant interactions (capture zones, spreading)\n",
    "- **(Optional for bonus credit)** Verify numerical results with analytical solutions\n",
    "- Communicate findings in a professional modeling report\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "1. This completed notebook with all code executed and results displayed\n",
    "2. Completed `case_config_transport.yaml` with justified parameter choices\n",
    "3. Professional report (3-4 pages PDF) summarizing methods, results, and conclusions\n",
    "4. **(Optional for bonus: +5-10%)** Analytical comparison section with plots and discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Questions to Answer\n",
    "- Will the pumping wells capture the TCE plume before it reaches the Limmat River?\n",
    "- What is the maximum extent of the contamination (area where C > 5 mg/L)?\n",
    "- When will contamination reach monitoring locations?\n",
    "- How do injection wells/Sickergalerie affect plume spreading?\n",
    "- **(Optional)** How well does a 1D analytical solution predict plume behavior compared to the full 2D/3D numerical model?"

    "### Key Concept: Steady Flow + Transient Transport\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume **steady-state flow** (heads don't change with time) but **transient transport** (concentrations evolve over time). This is the standard approach for long-term contamination problems because:\n",
    "- Groundwater flow reaches equilibrium quickly (days to weeks)\n",
    "- Contaminant transport is much slower (months to years)\n",
    "- Allows us to focus on transport processes without rerunning flow at each time step\n",

    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Flow Case Study | Transport Case Study |\n",
    "|--------|----------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| Starting model | Base parent model | Same fresh base parent model |\n",
    "| Wells | Student implements from concession | **Reuse from case_config.yaml** |\n",
    "| Scenarios | 3 stages + parameter variations | **Single run: wells + transport** |\n",
    "| Complexity | 3-stage workflow | **Simpler: 1-stage** |\n",
    "| Focus | Flow system response | **Contaminant fate and transport** |\n",
    "| Analysis | Drawdown, river leakage | **Plume migration, breakthrough** |\n",
