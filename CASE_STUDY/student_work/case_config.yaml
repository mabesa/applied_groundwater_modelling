title: "Impact of a well group on the groundwater flow field."  # TODO: tailor the title (you may refine but keep core meaning)

description: >
  TODO: Provide 2–5 sentences describing the specific groundwater flow problem for your
  concession: state the location context, purpose of the well group, and why assessing
  its impact matters (e.g. potential interference, river depletion, drawdown near
  sensitive receptors). You will implement the concessioned pumping rates and a
  50% pumping variant, then evaluate changes in heads, gradients, and river leakage.

model:
  # Baseline (do NOT modify baseline input files in place).
  workspace: "~/applied_groundwater_modelling_data/limmat/limmat_valley_model"
  namefile: "limmat_valley_model.nam"      # Assumed namefile; TODO: adjust if different
  baseline_model_name: "limmat_valley_model"

  # All group results should go into a dedicated folder using the group number.
  workspace: "~/applied_groundwater_modelling_data/limmat/case_study_0"  # auto-expand: replace <group_number>
  modelname_suffix: "0"       # MUST be exactly the integer group number (no text)

pumping:
  # Concession wells: implement provided locations & rates (m3/day; negative for extraction).
  # Provide a small table (inline or external file) listing wells you add/modify.
  wells_source: "concession"               # keep fixed

  apply_half_rate_variant: true             # Run an additional model with all concession rates * 0.5
  notes: >
    Briefly describe any assumptions in mapping concession data to model cells (e.g. snapping to nearest active cell).

scenarios:
  # Exactly ONE scenario id must be selected in group.chosen_scenario above.
  selection_instructions: >
    Choose one scenario that your group will implement in addition to the base concession pumping.
    Document any parameter multipliers you apply. Keep changes moderate to avoid solver instability.

implementation_plan: >
  TODO: Bullet the concrete steps you will perform (baseline load, add wells, run
  concession rates, run 50% rates, apply scenario parameter/stress change, produce maps
  of head difference, river leakage comparison, drawdown profiles, budget summaries).

evaluation_metrics: >
  TODO: Define 3–5 metrics (e.g. max drawdown at key location, total river leakage change (m3/day),
  area where drawdown > 0.5 m, change in gradient toward river, % change in discharge components).

deliverables: >
  TODO: List expected artifacts (plots, tables) & short narrative explaining impacts of the well group
  under concession vs 50% pumping and under the selected scenario.

quality_checks: >
  TODO: Briefly state how you will verify model stability (mass balance error, convergence, sensitivity bounds).
