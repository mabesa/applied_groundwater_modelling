    "The Limmat valley aquifer is a well-studied groundwater reservoir beneath the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Doppler and colleagues write, that it was formed during the last ice age, when the Lindt glacier retreated. The Limmat valley aquifer has no direct hydraulic connection to lake Zurich in the east where it is bound by impermeable lake sediments and moraine material. The aquifer is further confined in the north and south by the side morains of the Lindth glacier. Lateral inflow of groundwater from the hills in the north and south is to be expected. The groundwater body is further in connection with the river Sihl in the east and the river Limmat in the north. The hydraulic properties of the aquifer are higly heterogenic because of its complex geological history formed through various sedimentation and erosion events from the rivers Sihl and Limmat.

We will start with the federal office for the environment (FOEN) which maintains a network of groundwater observation wells.

One monitoring well maintained by FOEN is located in the Limmat valley aquifer but far downstream of our area of interest in the city center. Further, this well is a drinking water production well and can therefore not be used as an outflow boundary.  \n",
