Doppler and colleagues write, that it was formed during the last ice age, when the Lindt glacier retreated. The Limmat valley aquifer has no direct hydraulic connection to lake Zurich in the east where it is bound by impermeable lake sediments and moraine material. The aquifer is further confined in the north and south by the side morains of the Lindth glacier. Lateral inflow of groundwater from the hills in the north and south is to be expected. The groundwater body is further in connection with the river Sihl in the east and the river Limmat in the north.

These assumptions allow us to treat the complex three-dimensional flow problem as a simpler two-dimensional one by integrating flow over the entire aquifer thickness.\n",

    "> The key conditions that must be met for the Dupuit approximation to be valid are:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> *   *The water table gradient is small:* The slope of the phreatic surface must be gentle. This is the most critical assumption, as it implies that flow is almost entirely horizontal.\n",
    "> *   *Flow is horizontal:* It is assumed that the hydraulic head is constant with depth for any given vertical line. This means equipotential lines are vertical, and consequently, the flow lines are horizontal.\n",
    "> *   *The hydraulic gradient is equal to the slope of the water table:* The slope of the water table is assumed to be the hydraulic gradient (`i`) for the entire saturated thickness of the aquifer.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> When these conditions hold, we can use a modified form of Darcy's Law to calculate the discharge `Q` of the aquifer:\n",

    "The river-aquifer interaction is an important component of the groundwater flow model. The geometry of the river and its interaction with the aquifer will influence the groundwater flow direction and the groundwater levels in the aquifer.\n",
    "\n",

Visiting your model area is a great way to get a feel for the area and to understand the hydrological processes at play.

    "### Interactive Exploration of River-Aquifer Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below provides an interactive tool to help you visualize the complex relationship between a river and an adjacent unconfined aquifer. It consists of two main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Left Plot (Physical Cross-Section):** This shows a physical model of the river and the groundwater system. You can see the water level in the river (`H_riv`) and the water table in the aquifer (`H_aq`).\n",
    "2.  **Right Plot (Flux Relationship):** This is a conceptual graph that shows the calculated flux (flow rate, `Q_riv`) between the river and the aquifer as a function of the aquifer's head. The red dot indicates the current state of the system shown on the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Use This Figure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the two sliders below the plot to change the **Aquifer Head (`H_aq`)** and the **River Stage (`H_riv`)**. As you move the sliders, observe how the system changes in both plots. Pay close attention to the title, the equation, the direction of the flow (indicated by the arrow), and the position of the red dot on the flux curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenarios to Explore:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to create the following three fundamental conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Gaining Stream:**\n",
    "    *   **How to create it:** Set the aquifer head (`H_aq`) to be *higher* than the river stage (`H_riv`).\n",
    "    *   **What to observe:** Water flows from the aquifer into the river. The flux (`Q_riv`) is negative (flow *out of* the groundwater). The head difference (`ΔH`) is between `H_aq` and `H_riv`. Notice on the right plot that the red dot is in the negative flux region.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Losing Stream (Connected):**\n",
    "    *   **How to create it:** Set the river stage (`H_riv`) to be *higher* than the aquifer head (`H_aq`), but keep `H_aq` *above* the riverbed bottom (`R_bot`, the dashed brown line).\n",
    "    *   **What to observe:** Water flows from the river into the aquifer. The flux is positive and its magnitude depends directly on the head difference (`ΔH`). As you lower `H_aq`, the flux increases. The red dot on the right plot moves down the sloped part of the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Losing Stream (Disconnected):**\n",
    "    *   **How to create it:** Lower the aquifer head (`H_aq`) until it is *below* the riverbed bottom (`R_bot`).\n",
    "    *   **What to observe:** A yellow \"Vadose Zone\" appears between the riverbed and the water table, indicating they are no longer directly connected. The flow from the river now seeps downward at a constant, maximum rate. The flux no longer depends on `H_aq`. Notice that the head difference (`ΔH`) for the calculation is now between `H_riv` and `R_bot`. On the right plot, the red dot moves onto the vertical part of the curve, showing that the flux remains constant even if you continue to lower `H_aq`."
