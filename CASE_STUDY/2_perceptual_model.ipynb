    "The Limmat Valley Aquifer is a well-studied groundwater reservoir beneath the city of Zurich, Switzerland.

The aquifer has no direct hydraulic connection to Lake Zurich in the east, where it is bounded by impermeable lake sediments and moraine material. It is further confined in the north and south by the side moraines of the Linth glacier. Lateral inflow of groundwater from the surrounding hills is expected. The aquifer is also hydraulically connected to the river Sihl in the east and the river Limmat in the north. Its hydraulic properties are highly heterogeneous due to a complex geological history shaped by various sedimentation and erosion events from the rivers Sihl and Limmat [\\[1, 2\\]](#References).\n",

The aquifer is further confined in the north and south by the side moraines of the Linth glacier. Lateral inflow of groundwater from the hills in the north and south is to be expected. The most common approach is to use a water balance approach on the hillsides to estimate the subsurface inflow from the hills. We'll address this in the chapter on [climate data](#3---Climate-Forcing).

    "> *   *Flow is horizontal:* It is assumed that the hydraulic head is constant with depth for any given vertical line. This means equipotential lines are vertical, and therefore, the flow lines are horizontal.\n",

The flow from the river now seeps downward at a constant, maximum rate. The flux no longer depends on `H_aq`. Notice that the head difference (`ΔH`) for the calculation is now between `H_riv` and `R_bot`.

In the Hardhof well field, riverbank filtrate is extracted along the River Limmat, infiltrated into 3 recharge basins and 12 infiltration wells, and finally collected by four horizontal wells to be distributed into the drinking water network. The Hardhof site is quite complex to model, and we will not be able to fully reproduce its hydrogeology with our simplified model. Nevertheless, Hardhof is of great interest, as it employs an operational groundwater flow model that assimilates groundwater head observations to optimize infiltration in the vertical wells in real time. In fact, this is the site where real-time groundwater modeling and well field control were first developed more than a decade ago. According to the most recent statistical yearbook of the City of Zurich, the water works produce around 7 million cubic meters of groundwater per year [\\[14\\]](#references).  \n",
