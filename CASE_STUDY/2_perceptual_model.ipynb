Doppler and colleagues write, that it was formed during the last ice age, when the Lindt glacier retreated. The Limmat valley aquifer has no direct hydraulic connection to lake Zurich in the east where it is bound by impermeable lake sediments and moraine material. The aquifer is further confined in the north and south by the side morains of the Lindth glacier. Lateral inflow of groundwater from the hills in the north and south is to be expected. The groundwater body is further in connection with the river Sihl in the east and the river Limmat in the north. The hydraulic properties of the aquifer are higly heterogenic because of its complex geological history formed through various sedimentation and erosion events from the rivers Sihl and Limmat.

These assumptions allow us to treat the complex three-dimensional flow problem as a simpler two-dimensional one by integrating flow over the entire aquifer thickness.\n",

    "> The key conditions that must be met for the Dupuit approximation to be valid are:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> *   *The water table gradient is small:* The slope of the phreatic surface must be gentle. This is the most critical assumption, as it implies that flow is almost entirely horizontal.\n",
    "> *   *Flow is horizontal:* It is assumed that the hydraulic head is constant with depth for any given vertical line. This means equipotential lines are vertical, and consequently, the flow lines are horizontal.\n",
    "> *   *The hydraulic gradient is equal to the slope of the water table:* The slope of the water table is assumed to be the hydraulic gradient (`i`) for the entire saturated thickness of the aquifer.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> When these conditions hold, we can use a modified form of Darcy's Law to calculate the discharge `Q` of the aquifer:\n",

    "\n",
    "Figure 11 below provides an interactive tool to help you visualize the complex relationship between a river and an adjacent unconfined aquifer. It consists of two main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Left Plot (Physical Cross-Section):** This shows a physical model of the river and the groundwater system. You can see the water level in the river (`H_riv`) and the water table in the aquifer (`H_aq`).\n",
    "2.  **Right Plot (Flux Relationship):** This is a conceptual graph that shows the calculated flux (flow rate, `Q_riv`) between the river and the aquifer as a function of the aquifer's head. The red dot indicates the current state of the system shown on the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Use This Figure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the two sliders below the plot to change the **Aquifer Head (`H_aq`)** and the **River Stage (`H_riv`)**. As you move the sliders, observe how the system changes in both plots. Pay close attention to the title, the equation, the direction of the flow (indicated by the arrow), and the position of the red dot on the flux curve.\n",

    "**Scenarios to Explore:**\n",

    "Try to create the following three fundamental conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Gaining Stream:**\n",
    "    *   **How to create it:** Set the aquifer head (`H_aq`) to be *higher* than the river stage (`H_riv`).\n",
    "    *   **What to observe:** Water flows from the aquifer into the river. The flux (`Q_riv`) is negative (flow *out of* the groundwater). The head difference (`ΔH`) is between `H_aq` and `H_riv`. Notice on the right plot that the red dot is in the negative flux region.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Losing Stream (Connected):**\n",
    "    *   **How to create it:** Set the river stage (`H_riv`) to be *higher* than the aquifer head (`H_aq`), but keep `H_aq` *above* the riverbed bottom (`R_bot`, the dashed brown line).\n",
    "    *   **What to observe:** Water flows from the river into the aquifer. The flux is positive and its magnitude depends directly on the head difference (`ΔH`). As you lower `H_aq`, the flux increases. The red dot on the right plot moves down the sloped part of the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Losing Stream (Disconnected):**\n",
    "    *   **How to create it:** Lower the aquifer head (`H_aq`) until it is *below* the riverbed bottom (`R_bot`).\n",
    "    *   **What to observe:** A yellow \"Vadose Zone\" appears between the riverbed and the water table, indicating they are no longer directly connected. The flow from the river now seeps downward at a constant, maximum rate. The flux no longer depends on `H_aq`. Notice that the head difference (`ΔH`) for the calculation is now between `H_riv` and `R_bot`. On the right plot, the red dot moves onto the vertical part of the curve, showing that the flux remains constant even if you continue to lower `H_aq`."

    "We have now gathered a lot of information about the Limmat valley aquifer and its hydrological and hydrogeological properties. We can now define the flow problem we want to solve with our numerical model. We can now also define the model area and the model grid.:\n",
    "- The model area is the Limmat valley aquifer, which is bounded by the river Sihl in the east and the river Limmat in the north.\n",
    "- The model grid is a 2D grid with a variable thickness, based on the aquifer thickness from the GIS-browser. The grid will have a resolution of 50 m in the horizontal direction and a variable thickness in the vertical direction, based on the aquifer thickness from the GIS-browser.\n",
    "- The aquifer is unconfined and the top of the aquifer is represented by the topography of the Limmat valley: No-flow boundary at the bottom of the aquifer. \n",
    "- The lateral inflow from the hills in the north and south of the Limmat valley aquifer is estimated using a water balance approach on the hill sides and distributed evenly along the inflow boundaries. It is estimated using climate data and a first approximation of 20% of the precipitation infiltrating into the aquifer: Constant or time variant pre-defined lateral inflow in the north and south. \n",
    "- The river-aquifer interaction is estimated using a 3rd type boundary condition with a head-dependent flux from the river into the aquifer. \n",
    "- The outflow boundary is a fixed-head boundary condition based on the groundwater level at piezometer 481.\n",
    "- The areal recharge is estimated using the climate data from the Fluntern station and a first approximation of 10% of the precipitation infiltrating into the aquifer. At the model top we have a pre-defined constant or transient flux boundary. \n",
    "\n",
    "We draw the model boundary polygon manually in QGIS and export it as a geopackage layer. Given the complex geometry of aquifer thickness, this is the fastest method. We can then use this layer to define the model area in our numerical model. \n",

The Hardhof is very interesting for us though, as they use an operational groundwater flow model that assimilated groundwater head observations to optimize the infiltration in the vertical wells in real-time. In fact, this is the site, where real-time groundwater modelling and well field control was first developed more than a decade ago.
