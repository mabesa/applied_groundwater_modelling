For the latter, we assume that the lower range corresponds to the contour line of the aquifer thickness. For the deeper zones, we will use the contour lines to define the bottom layer of the model. We'll walk you through the steps to create the bottom layer of the model in the following code cells.\n",

Please note that the aquifer thickness is very thin in parts of the model area. Cells in this region may run dry during the simulation, which is a common occurrence in groundwater models of shallow unconfined aquifers. By default, cells that run dry become impermeable in modflow but we can set rewetting parameters which allow the model to iteratively re-activate dry cells. This can, however, lead to numerical instability. We'll have to keep an eye on this during the simulation and adjust the model parameters for re-wetting if necessary."
