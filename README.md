<summary><strong>üë©‚Äçüíª For Developers: Implementing Accessibility</strong></summary>

### üéØ Core Design Principles

#### 1. Keep It Simple
- **Minimal layouts**: Avoid complex HTML structures or custom CSS
- **Standard Markdown**: Use native Markdown features whenever possible
- **Portable design**: Ensure content works across VS Code, JupyterLab, and JupyterHub
- **Screen reader first**: Design with screen readers in mind, not as an afterthought

#### 2. Accessibility-First Development
Every contribution should consider accessibility from the start, not as a retrofit.

### üìù Content Guidelines

#### Markdown Content Boxes
**‚úÖ DO:**
```markdown
> üí° **Example: Clear Title**
> 
> Content goes here with clear, descriptive text.
> Mathematical expressions should include text explanations.
```

**‚ùå DON'T:**
```html
<div class="custom-box fancy-styling">
  <h4>Example</h4>
  <p>Content without clear structure</p>
</div>
```

#### Headings and Structure
**‚úÖ DO:**
- Use logical heading hierarchy (H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3)
- Make headings descriptive and meaningful
- Include section numbers when appropriate

```markdown
# 1. Introduction to Groundwater Flow
## 1.1 Basic Principles
### 1.1.1 Darcy's Law
```

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Skip heading levels
- Use headings for styling only
- Make vague headings like "More Info"

### üñºÔ∏è Images and Visual Content

#### Alt Text Requirements
**All images MUST include descriptive alt text:**

```markdown
![Graph showing groundwater head decline over time from 2010 to 2020, starting at 15m and declining to 8m with steepest decline between 2015-2017](path/to/image.png)
```

#### Alt Text Guidelines
**‚úÖ Good alt text:**
- Describes the content and purpose of the image
- Includes key data points for graphs/charts
- Explains relationships shown in diagrams
- Mentions relevant colors/patterns when they convey information

**‚ùå Poor alt text:**
- "Graph" or "Image" (too vague)
- "See image above" (not descriptive)
- Overly long descriptions (keep under 125 characters for simple images)

#### Complex Figures
For complex diagrams or multi-panel figures:

```markdown
![Conceptual model of the Limmat Valley aquifer showing three main layers: unconfined gravel aquifer (top, 0-10m depth), confining clay layer (middle, 10-15m), and confined sandstone aquifer (bottom, 15-30m). Arrows indicate groundwater flow from recharge areas in the east toward discharge at the Limmat River in the west.](path/to/figure.png)

**Figure description:** This conceptual cross-section illustrates...
[Provide detailed text description in following paragraph]
```

### üß© Interactive Elements

#### Progress Trackers and Widgets
**‚úÖ DO:**
- Use standard `ipywidgets` with proper labels
- Include descriptive text for all interactive elements
- Provide fallback text versions for non-interactive environments

```python
checkbox = widgets.Checkbox(
    value=False,
    description="Step 1: Problem Definition - Mark complete when you understand how to define modeling objectives",
    style={'description_width': 'initial'},
    layout=widgets.Layout(width='100%')
)
```

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Create custom widgets without accessibility testing
- Use unlabeled interactive elements
- Rely solely on color to convey information

#### Forms and Input
- Always provide clear labels for input fields
- Include help text or examples when needed
- Use logical tab order for keyboard navigation

### üé® Visual Design

#### Color and Contrast
**‚úÖ DO:**
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 minimum for normal text)
- Use color plus another indicator (icons, patterns, text) to convey information
- Test with color blindness simulators

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Use color alone to distinguish important information
- Use low-contrast color combinations
- Assume all users can perceive color differences

#### Layout and Spacing
**‚úÖ DO:**
- Use consistent spacing and alignment
- Keep line lengths readable (45-75 characters)
- Provide white space for visual breathing room

```markdown
> üìö **Theory: Groundwater Flow Equation**
> 
> The groundwater flow equation combines Darcy's law with the principle of mass conservation:
> 
> ‚àá ¬∑ (K‚àáh) = S ‚àÇh/‚àÇt + Q
> 
> Where K is hydraulic conductivity, h is hydraulic head, S is specific storage, and Q represents sources/sinks.
```

### üíª Code and Technical Content

#### Code Blocks
**‚úÖ DO:**
- Use syntax highlighting with language specification
- Include comments explaining complex sections
- Provide context for code examples

        pumping_rate (float): Constant pumping rate (m¬≥/day)
        distance (float): Distance from pumping well (meters)
    
    Returns:
        dict: Calculated aquifer properties
    """
    # Implementation here...
```

#### Mathematical Content
**‚úÖ DO:**
- Provide text explanations alongside equations
- Define all variables and symbols
- Use consistent mathematical notation

```markdown
The Darcy velocity (v) is calculated as:

v = Ki

Where:
- v = Darcy velocity (m/day)
- K = hydraulic conductivity (m/day)  
- i = hydraulic gradient (dimensionless)
```

### üöÄ Quick Reference

#### Standard Content Box Format
```markdown
> [EMOJI] **[TYPE]: [TITLE]**
> 
> Content goes here. Keep it clear and concise.
> 
> For complex content, break into multiple paragraphs.
```

#### Image with Alt Text
```markdown
![Descriptive alt text explaining what the image shows, including key data points and relationships](path/to/image.png)

## Data Management

This course uses external datasets that are automatically downloaded when needed and stored to the folder `appplied_groundwater_modelling_data` in your home directory. The data download system is configured through a `config.py` file that specifies data sources and repository links.

Please look at `config_template.py` for a template of the configuration file, containing publicly available data for the Limmat valley aquifer model. You can copy this file to `config.py` and modify it according to your needs.

### Default Public Data Access

By default, the course uses publicly available data for the Limmat valley aquifer case study. No additional configuration is required for most users.

### Private Data Access (Workshop Participants)

Workshop participants will receive a `config.py` file with links to additional private datasets and repositories. Place this file in the root directory of the repository (same level as `README.md`).

**Important:** The `config.py` file contains links to private repositories and should not be shared or committed to version control. It is automatically ignored by git.

### Data Configuration

The data system supports multiple case studies and data sources:

- **Case Studies**: `limmat` (default), `zarafshan`
- **Data Sources**: `dropbox`, `switch`

To modify data sources, edit your `config.py` file:

```python
# Choose case study
CASE_STUDY = "limmat"  # or "zarafshan"

# Choose data source
DATA_SOURCE = "dropbox"  # or "switch"
```

### Data Download

Data is automatically downloaded when needed using functions like:

```python
from data_utils import download_named_file

# Download a specific dataset
file_path = download_named_file(
    name='groundwater_map_norm',
    data_type='gis'
)
```

Downloaded data is stored in `~/applied_groundwater_modelling_data/[case_study]/` and organized by data type (climate, rivers, gis, etc.).

## Repository Structure
(to be refined)

The applied groundwater modelling course uses data downloaded from sources configured in the file config.py (see config_template.py for a template). The downloaded data is stored in the `applied_groundwater_modelling_data` folder on the same hierarchical level as the course repository.

- **Submit a Pull Request**: Create a pull request to the develop branch with a clear description of what your changes accomplish. We will review your contribution and provide feedback.

### Notebook Output Management (Required)
To keep the repository clean and free of unnecessary output, notebook outputs should be cleared before committing. Contributors have two options:

#### Option 1: Manual Output Clearing (Simple)
Before committing notebooks, manually clear all outputs:
- **In Jupyter/JupyterLab**: `Kernel` ‚Üí `Restart & Clear Output`
- **In VS Code**: Use the "Clear All Outputs" button in the notebook toolbar
- **Command line**: Use `jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace your_notebook.ipynb`

#### Option 2: Automated with nbstripout (Recommended for Regular Contributors)
Set up `nbstripout` to automatically strip outputs during commits:

1. **Activate the pre-commit hook** (installed with the `environment_development.yml` file):
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```
2. **Install `nbstripout`** in your conda environment: 
   ```bash
   conda install nbstripout
   ```
3. **Enable `nbstripout`** for your repository:
   ```bash
   nbstripout --install
   ```
4. **Verify the setup** by checking the `.git/hooks/pre-commit` file. It should contain a line similar to:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh
   nbstripout --strip
   ```
5. **Automatic stripping**: Once set up, `nbstripout` will automatically strip output from all Jupyter notebooks when you commit changes.
6. **Skip specific notebooks** (if needed):
   ```bash
   nbstripout --skip-notebook your_notebook.ipynb
   ```

**Important**: Please ensure notebook outputs are cleared using either method before submitting pull requests to maintain clean repository history.

## Troubleshooting

### Troubleshooting Git repo on JupyterHub
It may happen, that your repository on JupyterHub is not up to date with the latest version of the course repository. In this case, you can update your repository by running the following commands in a terminal on JupyterHub:

```bash
# TODO: add this to the diagnostics script for Jupyter Hub
# Navigate to the course repository
cd ~/applied_groundwater_modelling.git
# Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository
git fetch origin
# Check the status of your local repository
git status
# You cannot commit any changes. You need to reset your local repository to match the remote 'course_2025' branch
# Reset your local repository to match the remote 'course_2025' branch
git reset --hard origin/course_2025
```

### 405: Method Not Allowed on JupyterHub
This error may occur if you try to access a resource or endpoint that is not allowed on the JupyterHub server. This error can happen when you store the link to your JupyterHub environment in a Bookmark. The url to your JupyterHub environment can change from time to time. 

### Troubleshooting Data Downloads

**"No URL configured" error:**
- Ensure you have a valid `config.py` file or that `config_template.py` contains the required dataset
- Check that the dataset name matches exactly (case-sensitive)

**Download failures:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify that the repository links are accessible
- For private repositories, ensure the links in your `config.py` are current

**"Path does not exist" errors:**
- The data download system creates directories automatically
- Ensure you have write permissions in your home directory
- Check that `~/applied_groundwater_modelling_data/` can be created

**For workshop participants:**
- Do not share your `config.py` file as it contains links to private repositories
- If you lose your `config.py`, contact the instructors for a replacement
- The `config.py` file should be placed in the root directory of the repository
