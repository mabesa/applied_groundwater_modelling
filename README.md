### Basic Implementation

Add accessibility support to any notebook:

```python
# Standard imports
import sys
sys.path.append('../SUPPORT_REPO/src')
from accessibility_config import create_accessibility_switch
from print_images import display_image

# Add accessibility control panel
accessibility_switch = create_accessibility_switch()
display(accessibility_switch)
```

### Best Practices

**1. Always Include Alt-Text:**
```python
display_image(
    "diagram.png",
    alt_text="Detailed description of the diagram content and significance",
    caption="Figure 1: Descriptive caption",
    educational_context="How this relates to learning objectives"
)
```

**2. Provide Educational Context:**
```python
display_figure_with_context(
    "complex_diagram.png",
    figure_number=1,
    title="Groundwater Flow Patterns",
    description="Cross-section showing flow lines and equipotential lines",
    learning_objective="Understanding flow visualization techniques",
    source="Course Materials 2025"
)
```

### Key Functions

| Function | Purpose | Accessibility Features |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| `display_image()` | Basic image display | Conditional alt-text, context boxes, adaptive sizing |

<summary><strong>üíª Local Installation Setup</strong></summary>

We recommend Visual Studio Code as an IDE (available for free [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) but any other Python IDE will work. We further recommend using the Anaconda distribution of Python (available for free [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)) to manage your Python environment.  

To run these materials locally, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to your desired directory** in your terminal using the `cd` command:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/folder
   ```
   Replace `path/to/your/folder` with the actual path to your desired folder.

2. **Clone this repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mabesa/applied-groundwater-modeling.git
   ```
   This will create a new folder called `applied-groundwater-modeling` in your current directory.

3. **Navigate into the cloned repository:**
   ```bash
   cd applied-groundwater-modeling
   ```

4. **Set up your Python environment using conda:**
   - Update conda (may take a while):  
     ```bash
     conda update -n base -c conda-forge conda
     ```
   - Create a new environment with Python 3.12 and the required packages:  
     ```bash

### Notebook Output Management (Required)
To keep the repository clean and free of unnecessary output, notebook outputs should be cleared before committing. Contributors have two options:

#### Option 1: Manual Output Clearing (Simple)
Before committing notebooks, manually clear all outputs:
- **In Jupyter/JupyterLab**: `Kernel` ‚Üí `Restart & Clear Output`
- **In VS Code**: Use the "Clear All Outputs" button in the notebook toolbar
- **Command line**: Use `jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace your_notebook.ipynb`

#### Option 2: Automated with nbstripout (Recommended for Regular Contributors)
Set up `nbstripout` to automatically strip outputs during commits:

1. **Activate the pre-commit hook** (installed with the `environment_development.yml` file):
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```
2. **Install `nbstripout`** in your conda environment: 
   ```bash
   conda install nbstripout
   ```
3. **Enable `nbstripout`** for your repository:
   ```bash
   nbstripout --install
   ```
4. **Verify the setup** by checking the `.git/hooks/pre-commit` file. It should contain a line similar to:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh
   nbstripout --strip
   ```
5. **Automatic stripping**: Once set up, `nbstripout` will automatically strip output from all Jupyter notebooks when you commit changes.
6. **Skip specific notebooks** (if needed):
   ```bash
   nbstripout --skip-notebook your_notebook.ipynb
   ```

**Important**: Please ensure notebook outputs are cleared using either method before submitting pull requests to maintain clean repository history.
