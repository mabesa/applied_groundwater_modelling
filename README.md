# Groundwater Modelling Lecture
 Project-based lecture material for teaching groundwater modelling.

## Overview
This repository contains the lecture material for a project-based course on groundwater modelling. The course is designed for students with a basic understanding of hydrogeology and groundwater flow. The course is structured around a series of lectures and practical exercises that introduce students to the fundamentals of groundwater modelling using MODFLOW and FloPy. The course is designed to be taught over a 12-week semester with 2 hours of lectures and 2 hours of practical exercises each week which are expected to be integrated into a report.

## How to use this material

### Prerequisites
This course is designed for students with a basic understanding of hydrogeology and groundwater flow. Students should have a basic understanding of the following concepts:
- Darcy's Law
- Hydraulic conductivity
- Aquifer properties
- Groundwater flow
- Groundwater wells
- Groundwater recharge and discharge
- Groundwater flow equations
- Groundwater flow boundary conditions
- Analytical solutions to groundwater flow problems
Students have a number of self assessments available to test their understanding of these concepts.
