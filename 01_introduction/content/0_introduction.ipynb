    "This course is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in groundwater modeling, equipping you with the knowledge and skills needed to tackle real-world challenges in engineering tasks in groundwater, groundwater management and environmental protection.\n",

    "## Why this course?\n",
    "In your future career, you will be faced with a variety of challenges related to groundwater. You might work in a government agency, a consulting firm, or an environmental organization. You might be involved in groundwater management, remediation of contaminated sites, or the design of groundwater monitoring systems. This course will provide you with the tools and techniques needed to address these challenges. \n",

The model suffered from inadequate scale, poor calibration, and compounding assumptions, rendering it unreliable. The decision had significant repercussions for the construction sector and national economy. See HÃ¶glund et al. (2025) for a discussion of this case.<br>\n",
