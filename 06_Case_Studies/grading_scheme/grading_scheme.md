# How the report will be graded
The report should have the following structure (indicative volume in percentage of the report volume is given in parentheses):

- Objectives (10%)
- Site description (10%)
- Data collection (5%)
- Conceptual model (10%) - not covered yet
- Model setup (10%)
- Model calibration (10%) - not covered yet
- Model validation (10%) - not covered yet
- Scenario analysis (10%)
- Discussion (10%)
- Conclusions (10%)

The report will be graded based on the following criteria:
Content (60%)
Layout (40%)

Layout is important! It is what you hand out to your customers in written form and which will be dough out even years after project end if a new project is happening in the same location. It should be clear, concise, and easy to read.
Here are some tips:
- No numbers without units (or `-` for dimensionless quantities)
- Consistend font size and type
- Consistent numbering of figures and tables
- Figures and tables have captions (figures below, tables above).
- Each figure and table is referenced in the text.
- Table formatting is consistent (e.g., units in parentheses, right-aligned numbers (or aligned by decimal point), left-aligned text, etc.)
- Consistent numbering of chapters and sections
- Consistent referencing of figures, tables, and chapters, equations, etc.
- Correct referencing of sources
